## Project 4 high school portal

I'm building a website for my high school. Here is the link  [Chebosi High school](http://p4.tindoclass.me/).

### Project Description

*This is a site for my high school. We have a facebook page but there is need to have a more secure and accesible portal

 
for the school to track alumnis and also provide a news feed for students and the community

The goal of this project is to have former students and current student keep track of what is happening in the school. 

### Demo Info

I did a demo during our Wednesday lecture

### Tables
This site has four tables, user, alumni, subject, score. Subject and score are related with a foreign key. 

### Addition

I used bootrap for the interface with a toggle menu to hide and unhide the site. 

I also used Java script in the project.
