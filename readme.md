## Project 4 high school portal

I'm building a website for my high school. Here is the link  [Chebosi High school](http://p4.tindoclass.me/).

### Project Description

*This is a site for my high school. We have a facebook page but there is need to have a more secure and accesible portal

*You can log into the site


*Register your info on the alumni page


*Edit and delete alumni info 

* Main object for this site is to have colaboration between current and former students of Chebosi High School

### Demo Info

I did a demo during our Wednesday lecture

### Tables

This site has four tables, user, alumni, subject, score. Subject and score are related with a foreign key.

### Note to TA
 For CRUD I have added delete and edit on the alumni info on the alumni page.  
 
 Currently anyone can edit and delete the page. Ths is just temporal to meet the requirements for the class. 
 Only the Admin will be able to edit in the future. 
 
 I'm still waiting for Data to the "Facility page" from the school. Currently this page is still under construction.

### Addition

I used bootrap for the interface with a toggle menu to expand or minimize the page. 

I also used Java script and Jquery in the project.
